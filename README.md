# ATM

This program contains an ATM system where I could level up my programming knowledge.

I had an overview of how to gain efficiency in operating a program and its organization and logic. Still in development, I hope to improve even more.

I used mostly Python in this project, as my objective was to gain a more logical and direct approach to developing a program.
